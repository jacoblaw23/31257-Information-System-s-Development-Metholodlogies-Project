competitive advantages:
The process of developing a new information system to improve the operation of the in house call management cenre (CMC) comes with a 
number of advantages. The incorporation of an upgraded information system allows the CMC to gain a competitive advantage over other
business's. A major advantage would be enhanced and more smooth operations. Some more potential benefits for the call centre include 
the reduction in costs for inbound calls by reducing per-call handling time, decreased manual labour due to more technology, and a deduction
in operation/administration expenses. The new system will allow the ability to carry out more effective and efficient calls, as well as
improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls. The ehnanced efficency of operations 
result reduction in customer wait times, improved customer service and improved RM performance, increased customer attraction & loyalty,
all which would lead to higher sales of travel packages and ultimately result in higher profits.

However, whilst there are a number of benefits derived from an upgraded information system, there are also possible 
adverse effects for the business if its information system project fails.
