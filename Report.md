# Problem Definition
The business has experienced an increasing number of customer complaints related to their experiences inquiring about travel packages. Customers often described their relationship manager (RM) as lacking an understanding of the travel package in question, and sometimes expressed issues with being sold products they had no interest in. The business conducted an internal investigation and discovered the following problems:

* RMs were sometimes unable to answer questions relating to specific travel packages
* RMs were sometimes unable to handle customers due to language barriers
* RMs were sometimes unable to handle customers due to already being busy with another customer; the customer was put on hold
* RMs were sometimes conducting random sales pitches (instead of targeted pitches) in order to meet sales numbers
* The number of customer complaints is related to the number of available travel packages at the time

The business aims to resolve the above problems using an IT solution, with the goal being an improved customer experience.

## Point of View (POV) Statements 
### Customer 
The customer needs to talk to the appropriate person over the phone to fulfil their needs  as their needs will be filled by a RM whose speciality department matches their needs.

### Relationship Manager
The relationship manager needs to receive calls from customers that match their specialities, because they will be able to help customers better as they are familiar with the specific area.

### Branch Manager
The branch manager needs to increase customer retention by improving customer experience through the process of assigning calls to RMs which are more suited to their skillset.

* Customers are complaining about poor sales experiences
* Customers are complaining more frequently; since more travel packages were made available
* RMs conduct random sales pitches (not targeted sales pitches) to customers in order to meet sales numbers
