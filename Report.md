# Problem Definition
The business has experienced an increasing number of customer complaints related to their experiences with the relationship manager (RM). Customers often described the RM as unknowledgeable about their desired travel package, and sometimes expressed disinterest in the product they were being sold.

# Business Objectives
* Speed Up Responses and Reduce Abandons; fast response times and low abandon rates.
* Boost Customer Satisfaction
* Increase the Effectiveness of the Service Recovery Programmes
* Improve Forecast Accuracy; ensure customers donâ€™t have to wait for an answer, getting the numbers right is essential
* Minimise inbound call costs by reducing per-call handling time
* Reduce customer wait times
* The system effectively matches customer with an RM.
* Reduce Customer Effort

An investigation into the source of customer complaints revealed the following issues:
* RMs were sometimes unable to cope with the large number of travel packages available for purchase
* RMs were sometimes unable to cope with the number of customers being transferred to them; customer put on hold
* RMs were sometimes unable to sell products to customers due to cultural differences
* RMs were sometimes unable to communicate with customers due to language barriers
* RMs were sometimes conducting random sales pitches to many customers in order to meet sales numbers

The business aims to resolve these issues using an IT solution, with the goal being an improved customer experience.

## Point of View (POV) Statements 
### Customer 
The customer needs to talk to the appropriate person over the phone to fulfil their needs  as their needs will be filled by a RM whose speciality department matches their needs.

### Relationship Manager
The relationship manager needs to receive calls from customers that match their specialities, because they will be able to help customers better as they are familiar with the specific area.
# Design Approach
Describe the AGILE approach (Scrum) used in this project and explain why it was chosen. Outline the Scrum activities used during this project.

# Assumptions

* The scripts used for sales pitches are created by the business and stored in a fixed location for the system to access
* Calls that are not answered by RM for a specific package are routed to an automated voicemail system
* Calls received are sorted based on whether customer is an ongoing client or a new Potential client
