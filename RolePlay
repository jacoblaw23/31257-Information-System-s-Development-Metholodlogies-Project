What features do you specifically expect from this system?
Customer:
RM (Sales Representative):

    To be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. From my understanding the new system
    is supposed to help because it connects me with more suitable clients, either
    because they are interested in the travel packages I specialise in or because I
    speak their preferred language. The latter would be especially useful since it
    would mean I would need to transfer less calls.

    I would also expect the system to work, that's for sure. I wouldn't want to use
    a system that doesn't work all the time. That would make things pointless and
    confusing.

Do you have any concerns regarding any features in other similar systems? Why/why not?
Customer:
RM (Sales Representative):

    Some coworkers are nervous about our boss receiving more information about how
    we spend our time here, but we get our work done. Can you guarantee the system
    won't expose any sensitive information?

    I have seen other systems where it learns and changes recommendations as time goes
    by. Does the system learn about me? What does it learn?

Do you think we could incorporate those features and improve it in our system? 
Customer:
RM (Sales Representative):

    You should definately incorporate those features. I wouldn't have raised them
    otherwise. I'm not sure about improving them though. It seems to be what everyone
    else is doing, so it sounds like the right way to go. Maybe we could get some
    kind of feedback on what the system thinks about our performance?

What else do you think may incorporate to enhance the system?
Customer:
RM (Sales Representative):

    Something that remembers regular clients and makes some special notification
    about when they're going to call again would be nice. Or something that tracks
    how long it's been since our last call. It would be great if we could improve the
    experience for our regular customers; they would keep coming back.

How do you feel about learning a new system?
Customer:
RM (Sales Representative):

    I don't want to have to change the way I do things completely. I want to be
    comfortable doing what I always do. I am willing to learn though.
